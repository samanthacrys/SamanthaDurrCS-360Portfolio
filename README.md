* Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The requirements of the application I developed was to create an inventory system for a warehouse. The users needed to be able to update the quantity of the items in inventory, removed items, and added items. There was an extra features that I knew of from my experience working at a manufacturing company that involved the location within the warehouse of the items. There was also a need to inform the users of when an item within the warehouse reached a count of 0 units left. The app was designed to address these needs and make it easier to find within the warehouse for the users.

* What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The system needed to have a database that would hold onto the information of the different items and users within the system. The screens that were needed were: login, new user, forgot password, inventory, inventory details, and add new item. The inventory details and forgot password were more in the fragment screen that is available within android studios, but it is still a necessary screen to allow users access. In addition to this, I also looked at the approach of ensuring that only the correct users could access the list. This went beyond the login page and added an element that also related to company ID. This meant that when a user logged in, they were able to only receive inventory information related to their job and not related to another company.

* How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

I approached the process of coding my application by trying to break it down and encapsulate the code within the necessary elements. I did not want to code everything in one section and by breaking it down into these smaller pieces, it was easier to figure out what went where. That meant that I didn’t have certain code in the wrong space. The techniques I used were to plan out what to get done each day and what time to spend where. That meant that I could spend more time trying to debug the application or find out where some things went wrong. I will admit that this didn’t work as well as I would have liked. When it comes to the future, breaking down the project into smaller pieces allows for a better ability to create the different components of the code. This allows for better securing of the code, but also to take the bigger picture and work with it in manageable pieces.

* How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

Of course, this did not come without issues. When it came to testing the code, I found that there were problems that caused me a lot of issues. The case being that, for some reason, my code database for the inventory failed and resulted in a whole section of my code getting overwritten with another code’s file. The result was that I lost a lot of the work that caused me to run out of time. This was revealed in the testing process as I was unable to get my inventory database to work the way that it should have. The reason that this is important to the entire scope of things is that testing the code revealed where something may have been wrong. While my error happened later in the process than I would have liked, I would have more easily been able to either call up a back up to restore the missing code or recode what I could. That revealed the error, as I may not otherwise notice it because it had been working the previous time I tested it before this happened.

* Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

The biggest part that I found challenging actually came from the fact that I had experience in terms of warehouse inventory software. Since I had worked in a manufacturing company and had to interact with the software and even do inventory audits, I could call up extra features and elements that are considered useful or wanted. The problem with this is that when you’re in a more constrained timeframe, I had to learn to scale back what I had initially proposed in my design documentation and early design to make this easier to code within the deadline. The way I innovated was by finding the necessary components that were asked for in the initial plan presented to me and worked around it and still output something that would be useful for warehouse staff, even without these extra features.

* In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

In all honesty, I would have to say that the most specific component that demonstrated my knowledge, skills, and experience had nothing to do with the coding of the application, or even the base design as I am still not used to Android Studio’s way of doing things. It actually goes all the way back to the first project with my design document where I was able to break down all of the different portions of the code and provide base wireframe designs to show what the proposed design there. My experience in both writing and working in a manufacturing company allowed me to take the knowledge I had from that and provide a cohesive document for the final project.
